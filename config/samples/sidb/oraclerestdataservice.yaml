  ## Dedicated persistent storage is optional. If not specified, ORDS will use persistent storage from .spec.databaseRef
  ## size is the required minimum size of the persistent volume
  ## storageClass is used for automatic volume provisioning
  ## accessMode can only accept one of ReadWriteOnce, ReadWriteMany
  ## volumeName is optional. Specify for binding to a specific PV and set storageClass to an empty string to disable automatic volume provisioning
  # persistence:
  #  size: 50Gi
  ## oci-bv applies to OCI block volumes. Use "standard" storageClass for dynamic provisioning in Minikube. Update as appropriate for other cloud service providers
  #  storageClass: "oci-bv"
  #  accessMode: "ReadWriteOnce"
  #  volumeName: ""

  ## Type of service  Applicable on cloud enviroments only.
  ## if loadBalService: false, service type = "NodePort" else "LoadBalancer"

  ## Deploy only on nodes having required labels. Format label_name: label_value
  ## The same lables are applied to the created PVC
  ## For instance if the pods need to be restricted to a particular AD
  ## Leave commented if there is no such requirement
