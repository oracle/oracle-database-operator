# Contributing to This Repository

We welcome your contributions! There are multiple ways to contribute.

## Opening issues

For bugs or enhancement requests, please file a GitHub issue unless the problem is security-related. When filing a bug, remember that the more specific the bug is, the more likely it is to be fixed. If you think you've found a security
vulnerability, then do not raise a GitHub issue. Instead, follow the instructions in our
[security policy](./SECURITY.md).

## Contributing code

We welcome your code contributions. Before submitting code by using a pull request,
you must sign the [Oracle Contributor Agreement][OCA] (OCA), and your commits must include the following line, using the name and e-mail address you used to sign the OCA:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.org>
```

You can add this line automatically to pull requests by committing with `--sign-off`
or `-s`. For example:

```text
git commit --signoff
```

Only pull requests from committers that can be verified as having signed the OCA
can be accepted.

## Pull request process

1. Ensure there is an issue created to track and discuss the fix or enhancement that you intend to submit.
1. Fork this repository.
1. Create a branch in your fork to implement the changes. Oracle recommends using
   the issue number as part of your branch name. For example: `1234-fixes`
1. Ensure that any documentation is updated with the changes that are required
   by your change.
1. Ensure that any samples are updated, if the base image has been changed.
1. Submit the pull request. *Do not leave the pull request blank*. Explain exactly
   what your changes are meant to do, and provide simple steps to indicate how to validate
   your changes. Ensure that you reference the issue that you created as well.
