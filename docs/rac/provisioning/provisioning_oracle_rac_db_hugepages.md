# Provisioning an Oracle RAC Database with Huge Page allocation

Provision an Oracle RAC database using HugePages on Kubernetes by deploying Oracle Grid Infrastructure and Oracle RAC Controller with a YAML configuration file that enables large-page memory allocation for each pod.

#### Use Case
* Oracle Grid Infrastructure and Oracle RAC Database are deployed automatically using Oracle RAC Controller. The responsefile is generated by the Oracle RAC Controller based on the input parameters specified in the `.yaml` file. 
* HugePages configured at the pod level, allocating 2MB per page for memory. 
* Oracle RAC database provisioned using the `racdb_prov_hugepages.yaml` file and Oracle RAC Controller. Provisioning includes the following:
  * Two Kubernetes Pods as the RAC Nodes
  * Headless services for RAC
    * VIP Service
    * Scan Service
    * RAC Node hostname
  * 2MB Huge Pages defined by the hugepages-2Mi parameter 
  * The `TOTAL_MEMORY` parameter sets the maximum allowable combined SGA and PGA for the Oracle Database instance
  * Shared Persistent volumes created automatically based on specified shared disks for RAC shared storage(ASM)
  * Software Persistent Volumes and Staged Software Persistent Volumes using the specified location on the corresponding worker nodes
  * Namespace: `rac` 
  * Staged Software location on the worker nodes is specified by `hostSwStageLocation`. Grid Infrastructure and RDBMS Binaries are copied to this location on the worker nodes. 
  * Software location on the worker nodes is specified by `racHostSwLocation`. The GI HOME and the RDBMS HOME in the Oracle RAC Pods will be mounted using this location on the corresponding worker node. 

For guidance on memory calculation when using HugePages to deploy an Oracle Restart Database in a Kubernetes cluster with Oracle Restart Controller, see:[Resource Management for Pods and Containers" in the Kubernetes K8 documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) 


### Example Details 
  * A pre-built Oracle RAC Database slim image available on Oracle OCIR i.e. `phx.ocir.io/intsanjaysingh/db-repo/oracle/database-rac:19.3.0-slim` is used. 
  * If you plan to build the image yourself, then you can build using the files from this [GitHub location](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/main/OracleDatabase/RAC/OracleRealApplicationClusters#building-oracle-rac-database-container-slim-image). In this case, Change the value of `image` with the image that you have built in your enviornment in file `racdb_prov_hugepages.yaml`. 
  * The ASM diskgroup is configured using the shared disks on the worker nodes: `/dev/disk/by-partlabel/qck-ocne19-asmdisk1` and `/dev/disk/by-partlabel/qck-ocne19-asmdisk2`. These disks are specified using parameter `asmDiskGroupDetails` in the YAML file. 

### Steps: Deploy 2 Node Oracle RAC Database with Huge Page allocation
Use this file: [racdb_prov_hugepages.yaml](./racdb_prov_hugepages.yaml) 

Complete all of these steps:

1. Deploy the `racdb_prov_hugepages.yaml` file:
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f racdb_prov_hugepages.yaml
    ```
2. Check the status of the deployment:
    ```sh
    # Check the status of the Kubernetes Pods:    
    kubectl get all -n rac
    
    # Check the logs of a particular pod. For example, to check status of pod "racnode1-0":    
    kubectl exec -it pod/racnode1-0 -n rac -- bash -c "tail -f /tmp/orod/oracle_db_setup.log"
    ===================================
    ORACLE RAC DATABASE IS READY TO USE
    ===================================
    ```
3. When this YAML file is applied, example logs are in in [Logs](./logs/racdb_prov_hugepages/racdbprov-sample_details.txt). The database Operator logs are in [DB Operator Logs](./logs/racdb_prov_hugepages/operator_logs.txt)
