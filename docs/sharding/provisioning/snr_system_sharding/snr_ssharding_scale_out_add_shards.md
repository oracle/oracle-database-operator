# Scale Out - Add Shards to an existing Oracle Globally Distributed Database Topology provisioned earlier with System-Managed Sharding and RAFT replication enabled

**NOTE: RAFT Replication Feature is available only for Oracle 23c RDBMS and Oracle 23c GSM version.**

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you have completed the steps for [Prerequsites for Running Oracle Sharding Database Controller](../../README.md#prerequsites-for-running-oracle-sharding-database-controller) before using Oracle Sharding Controller.

This use case demonstrates adding a new shard to an existing Oracle Globally Distributed Database topology with System-Managed sharding with RAFT Replication enabled provisioned earlier using Oracle Database Sharding controller.

In this use case, the existing Oracle Globally Distributed Database topology is having:

* Primary GSM Pods `gsm1` and standby GSM Pod `gsm2`
* Three Shard Database Pods: `shard1`, `shard2` and `shard3`
* One Catalog Pod: `catalog`
* Namespace: `shns`
* `RAFT Replication` enabled

In this example, we are using pre-built Oracle Database and Global Data Services container images available on [Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com/)
  * To pull the above images from Oracle Container Registry, create a Kubernetes secret named `ocr-reg-cred` using your credentials with type set to `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` in the namespace `shns`.
  * If you plan to use images built by you, you need to change `dbImage` and `gsmImage` tag with the images you have built in your enviornment in file `snr_ssharding_shard_prov_extshard.yaml`.
  * To understand the Pre-requisite of Database and Global Data Services docker images, refer [Oracle Database and Global Data Services Docker Images](../../README.md#3-oracle-database-and-global-data-services-docker-images)
  * If the existing Oracle Globally Distributed Database Topology was deployed using [Oracle Database 23ai Free](https://www.oracle.com/database/free/get-started/) Image for Database and GSM, then the additional parameter `dbEdition: "free"` will be needed for the below .yaml file as well.

This use case adds two new shards `shard4`,`shard5` to above Sharding Topology.

Use the file: [snr_ssharding_shard_prov_extshard.yaml](./snr_ssharding_shard_prov_extshard.yaml) for this use case as below:

1. Deploy the `snr_ssharding_shard_prov_extshard.yaml` file:
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f snr_ssharding_shard_prov_extshard.yaml
    ```
2. Check the status of the deployment:
    ```sh
    # Check the status of the Kubernetes Pods:
    kubectl get all -n shns

    # Check the logs of a particular pod. For example, to check status of pod "shard4-0":
    kubectl logs -f pod/shard4-0 -n shns
