# Scale In - Delete an existing Shard from a working Oracle Globally Distributed Database provisioned earlier with User-Defined Sharding

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you have completed the steps for [Prerequsites for Running Oracle Sharding Database Controller](../../README.md#prerequsites-for-running-oracle-sharding-database-controller) before using Oracle Sharding Controller.

This use case demonstrates how to delete an existing Shard from an existing Oracle Globally Distributed Database topology with User-Defined Sharding provisioned using Oracle Database Sharding controller.

In this use case, the existing database Sharding is having:

* Primary GSM Pods `gsm1` and standby GSM Pod `gsm2`
* Five Shard Database Pods: `shard1`,`shard2`,`shard3`,`shard4` and `shard5`
* One Catalog Pod: `catalog`
* Namespace: `shns`
* User-Defined Sharding is specified using `shardingType: USER`

In this example, we are using pre-built Oracle Database and Global Data Services container images available on [Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com/)
  * To pull the above images from Oracle Container Registry, create a Kubernetes secret named `ocr-reg-cred` using your credentials with type set to `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` in the namespace `shns`.
  * If you plan to use images built by you, you need to change `dbImage` and `gsmImage` tag with the images you have built in your enviornment in file `udsharding_shard_prov_delshard.yaml`.
  * To understand the Pre-requisite of Database and Global Data Services docker images, refer [Oracle Database and Global Data Services Docker Images](../../README.md#3-oracle-database-and-global-data-services-docker-images)
  * In case you want to use the [Oracle Database 23ai Free](https://www.oracle.com/database/free/get-started/) Image for Database and GSM, then you will need to add the additional parameter `dbEdition: "free"` to the below .yaml file.

**NOTE:** Use tag `isDelete: enable` to delete the shard you want.

This use case deletes the shard `shard4` from the above Oracle Globally Distributed Database Topology.

Use the file: [udsharding_shard_prov_delshard.yaml](./udsharding_shard_prov_delshard.yaml) for this use case as below:

1. Move out the chunks from the shard to be deleted to another shard. For example, in the current case, before deleting the `shard4`, if you want to move the chunks from `shard4` to `shard2`, then you can run the below `kubectl` command where `/u01/app/oracle/product/23ai/gsmhome_1` is the GSM HOME:
    ```sh
    kubectl exec -it pod/gsm1-0 -n shns -- /u01/app/oracle/product/23ai/gsmhome_1/bin/gdsctl "move chunk -chunk all -source shard4_shard4pdb -target shard4_shard4pdb"
    ```
2. Confirm the shard to be deleted (`shard4` in this case) is not having any chunk using below command:
    ```sh
    kubectl exec -it pod/gsm1-0 -n shns -- /u01/app/oracle/product/23ai/gsmhome_1/bin/gdsctl "config chunks"
    ```
    If there is no chunk present in the shard to be deleted, you can move to the next step.

3. Apply the `udsharding_shard_prov_delshard.yaml` file:
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f udsharding_shard_prov_delshard.yaml
    ```
4. Check the status of the deployment:
    ```sh
    # Check the status of the Kubernetes Pods:
    kubectl get all -n shns
    ```

**NOTE:** 
- After you apply `udsharding_shard_prov_delshard.yaml`, the change may not be visible immediately and it may take some time for the delete operation to complete.
- If the shard, that you are trying to delete, is still having chunks, then the you will see message like below in the logs of the Oracle Database Operator Pod.
    ```sh
    INFO    controllers.database.ShardingDatabase   manual intervention required
    ```
  In this case, you will need to first move out the chunks from the shard to be deleted using Step 2 above and then apply the file in Step 3 to delete that shard.

To check the status, use the following command:
  ```sh
  # Switch to the primary GSM Container:
  kubectl exec -i -t gsm1-0 -n shns /bin/bash

  # Check the status shards:
  gdsctl config shard

  # Check the status of the chunks:
  gdsctl config chunks
  ```
