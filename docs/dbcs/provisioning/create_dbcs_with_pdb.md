# Deploy a OBDS DB System using OCI Oracle Base Database System (OBDS) alongwith PDB

In this use case, an OCI OBDS system is deployed using Oracle DB Operator OBDS controller along with PDB configuration

**NOTE** It is assumed that before this step, you have followed the [prerequisite](./../README.md#prerequisites-to-deploy-a-dbcs-system-using-oracle-db-operator-dbcs-controller) steps to create the configmap and the secrets required during the deployment.

Also, create a Kubernetes secret `pdb-password` using the file:

```bash
#---assuming the PDB password is in ./pdb-password file"

kubectl create secret generic pdb-password --from-file=./pdb-password -n default
```

This example uses `dbcs_service_with_pdb.yaml` to deploy a Single Instance OBDS VMDB using Oracle DB Operator OBDS Controller with:

- OCI Configmap as `oci-cred`  
- OCI Secret as `oci-privatekey`  
- Availability Domain for the OBDS VMDB as `OLou:US-ASHBURN-AD-1`
- Compartment OCID as `ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaa63yqilqhgxv3dszur3a2fgwc64ohpfy43vpqjm7q5zq4q4yaw72a`
- Database Admin Credential as `admin-password`  
- Database Name as `dbsystem24`  
- Oracle Database Software Image Version as `21c`  
- Database Workload Type as Transaction Processing i.e. `OLTP`  
- Database Hostname Prefix as `host24`
- Cpu Core Count as `1`
- Oracle VMDB Shape as `VM.Standard2.1`  
- SSH Public key for the OBDS system being deployed as `oci-publickey`  
- domain `subd215df3e6.k8stest.oraclevcn.com`
- OCID of the Subnet as `ocid1.subnet.oc1.iad.aaaaaaaa3lmmxwsykn2jc2vphzpq6eoyoqtte3dpwg6s5fzfkti22ibol2ua`
- PDB Name as `pdb_sauahuja_11`
- TDE Wallet Password as `tde-password`
- PDB Admin Password as `pdb-password`

**NOTE:** For the details of the parameters to be used in the .yaml file, please refer [here](./dbcs_controller_parameters.md). 

Use the file: [dbcs_service_with_pdb.yaml](./dbcs_service_with_pdb.yaml) for this use case as below:

1. Deploy the .yaml file:  
```bash
[root@docker-test-server OBDS]# kubectl apply -f dbcs_service_with_pdb.yaml
dbcssystem.database.oracle.com/dbcssystem-create-with-pdb created
```

2. Monitor the Oracle DB Operator Pod `pod/oracle-database-operator-controller-manager-665874bd57-g2cgw` for the progress of the OBDS VMDB deployment. 

NOTE: Check the DB Operator Pod name in your environment.

```bash
[root@docker-test-server OBDS]# kubectl logs -f pod/oracle-database-operator-controller-manager-665874bd57-g2cgw -n  oracle-database-operator-system
```
