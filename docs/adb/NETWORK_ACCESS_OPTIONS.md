# Configuring Network Access for Oracle Autonomous Database

To configure network access for Oracle Autonomous Database (Autonomous Database), review and complete the procedures in this document. 

Network access for Autonomous Database includes public access, and configuring secure access, either over public networks using access control rules (ACLs), or by using using private endpoints inside a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) in your tenancy. This document also describes procedures to configure the Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections, with the option either to require mutual TLS only, or to allow both one-way TLS and mutual TLS. 

For more information about these options, see: [Configuring Network Access with Access Control Rules (ACLs) and Private Endpoints ](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/autonomous-network-access.html#GUID-D2D468C3-CA2D-411E-92BC-E122F795A413).

## Supported Features
Review the following options available to you with Autonomous Database.

* [Configuring Network Access with Access Control Rules (ACLs)](#configuring-network-access-with-access-control-rules-acls) on shared Exadata infrastructure
* [Configure Network Access with Private Endpoint Access Only](#configure-network-access-with-private-endpoint-access-only) on shared Exadata infrastructure
* [Allowing TLS or Require Only Mutual TLS (mTLS) Authentication](#allowing-tls-or-require-only-mutual-tls-mtls-authentication) on shared Exadata infrastructure
* [Autonomous Database with access control list enabled](#autonomous-database-with-access-control-list-enabled-on-dedicated-exadata-infrastructure) on dedicated Exadata infrastructure

## Configuring Network Access with Allowing Secure Access from Anywhere

Before changing the Network Access to Allowing Secure Access from Anywhere, ensure that your network security protocol requries only mTLS (Mutual TLS) authentication. For more details, see: [Allow both TLS and mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication](#allow-both-tls-and-mutual-tls-mtls-authentication). If mTLS enforcement is already enabled on your Autonomous Database, then you can skip this step.

To specify that Autonomous Database can be connected from any location with a valid credential, complete one of the following procedures, based on your network access configuration.

### Option 1 - Change the Network Access from "Secure Access from Allowed IPs and VCNs Only" to "Allowing Secure Access from Anywhere"

## Configure Network Access with Private Endpoint Access Only

To change the Network Access to Private Endpoint Access Only, complete this procedure

1. Visit [Overview of VCNs and Subnets](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVCNs_topic-Overview_of_VCNs_and_Subnets.htm#console) and [Network Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/networksecuritygroups.htm#working) to see how to create VCNs, subnets, and network security groups (NSGs) if you haven't already created them. The subnet and the NSG must be in the same VCN.

2. Copy and paste the OCIDs of the subnet and NSG to the corresponding parameters. An example file is availble here: [`config/samples/adb/autonomousdatabase_update_network_access.yaml`](./../../config/samples/adb/autonomousdatabase_update_network_access.yaml):

    | Attribute | Type | Description | Required? |
    |----|----|----|----|
    | `subnetId` | string | The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the subnet the resource is associated with.<br><br> **Subnet Restrictions:**<br> - For bare metal DB systems and for single-node virtual machine DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.16.16/28.<br> - For Exadata and virtual machine 2-node Oracle RAC systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20.<br> - For Autonomous Database, setting `subnetID` disables public secure access to the database.<br> These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance.<br> Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction.<br> This restriction applies to both the client subnet and the backup subnet. | Yes |
    | `nsgIds` | string[] | The list of [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for the network security groups (NSGs) to which this resource belongs. Setting `nsgIds` to an empty list removes all resources from all NSGs. For more information about NSGs, see [Security Rule](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm).<br><br>    **NsgIds restrictions:**<br> - A network security group (NSG) is optional for Autonomous Databases with private access. The nsgIds list can be empty. | No |
    | `privateEndpointLabel` | string | The resource's private endpoint label.<br> - Setting the endpoint label to a non-empty string creates a private endpoint database.<br> - Resetting the endpoint label to an empty string, after the creation of the private endpoint database, changes the private endpoint database to a public endpoint database.<br> - Setting the endpoint label to a non-empty string value, updates to a new private endpoint database, when the database is disabled and re-enabled.<br>This setting cannot be updated in parallel with any of the following: licenseModel, cpuCoreCount, computeCount, computeModel, adminPassword, whitelistedIps, isMTLSConnectionRequired, dbWorkload, dbVersion, dbName, or isFreeTier. | No |

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: database.oracle.com/v1alpha1
    kind: AutonomousDatabase
    metadata:
      name: autonomousdatabase-sample
    spec:
      action: Update
      details:
        autonomousDatabaseOCID: ocid1.autonomousdatabase...
        subnetId: ocid1.subnet...
        nsgIds:
        - ocid1.networksecuritygroup...
      ociConfig:

    ```

## Allowing TLS or Require Only Mutual TLS (mTLS) Authentication
You can choose either to require mTLS authentication and disallow TLS authentication, or allow both mTLS and TLS authentication. 

### Require mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication and Disallow TLS Authentication

To configure your Autonomous Database instance to require mTLS connections and disallow TLS connections, complete this procedure.

1. Add the following parameters to the specification. An example file is availble here: [`config/samples/adb/autonomousdatabase_update_mtls.yaml`](./../../config/samples/adb/autonomousdatabase_update_mtls.yaml):

    | Attribute | Type | Description | Required? |
    |----|----|----|----|
    | `isMtlsConnectionRequired` | boolean| Indicates whether the Autonomous Database requires mTLS connections. | Yes |

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: database.oracle.com/v1alpha1
    kind: AutonomousDatabase
    metadata:
      name: autonomousdatabase-sample
    spec:
      action: Update
      details:
        autonomousDatabaseOCID: ocid1.autonomousdatabase...
        isMtlsConnectionRequired: true
      ociConfig:
        configMapName: oci-cred
        secretName: oci-privatekey
    ```

2. Apply the yaml:

    ```sh
    $ kubectl apply -f config/samples/adb/autonomousdatabase_update_mtls.yaml
    autonomousdatabase.database.oracle.com/autonomousdatabase-sample configured
    ```

### Allow both TLS and mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication

If your Autonomous Database instance is configured to allow only mTLS connections, then you can reconfigure the instance to permit both mTLS and TLS connections. When you reconfigure the instance to permit both mTLS and TLS, you can use both authentication types at the same time, so that connections are no longer restricted to require mTLS authentication.

This option only applies to Autonomous Databases on shared Exadata infrastructure. You can permit TLS connections when network access type is configured by using one of the following options:

* **Access Control Rules (ACLs)**: with ACLs defined.
* **Private Endpoint Access Only**: with a private endpoint defined.

Complete this procedure to allow both TLS and mTLS authentication.

1. Add the following parameters to the specification. An example file is availble here: [`config/samples/adb/autonomousdatabase_update_mtls.yaml`](./../../config/samples/adb/autonomousdatabase_update_mtls.yaml):

    | Attribute | Type | Description | Required? |
    |----|----|----|----|
    | `isMtlsConnectionRequired` | boolean| Indicates whether the Autonomous Database requires mTLS connections. | Yes |

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: database.oracle.com/v1alpha1
    kind: AutonomousDatabase

      action: Update
      details:
        autonomousDatabaseOCID: ocid1.autonomousdatabase...
        isMtlsConnectionRequired: false
      ociConfig:
        configMapName: oci-cred
        secretName: oci-privatekey
    ```

2. Apply the yaml:

    ```sh
    $ kubectl apply -f config/samples/adb/autonomousdatabase_update_mtls.yaml
    autonomousdatabase.database.oracle.com/autonomousdatabase-sample configured
    ```
